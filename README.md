# Art Sketches

First approach to generative art width ClojureScript and Quil
(Processing).

## Usage

Run `lein compile` command and open `index.html` in your browser.

For interactive development run `lein cljsbuild auto` command. This
command will be recompiling cljs to js each time you modify
`core.cljs` and you can see result immediately by refreshing page.
